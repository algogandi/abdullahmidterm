The Epic:

The new Feature I have added is the access authorization for the User Type (Access Controls). 
it is a feature that will limit and control the access for each user type among (Admin - Super Admin - Member).
For the new user registration, they can choose from one of this type from the drop-down menu (Admin - Super Admin - Member). 
Once the new user registered in the Web, and have chosen the type from the 3 above. 
The Web will automatically show the user type in the home page, with a 3 link.Each link is linked with 
the type of user which authorize the user to use (Only Admin Page - Only Super Admin Page - Only Member Page).
Each type of user can use the link, however, they are authorized to their type to go to their access page, 
otherwise, it will take them to the unauthorized page user, if they use the wrong link which take them to 
(this page is only "the type"). This Feature shows the access authorization for user Access Controls, 
with the ability to choose the type while register in the Web.







The user stories: 
•	Users can register to the Web by writing their information.
•	Users can choose which access authorization (Admin - Super Admin - Member) they want by using the drop-down. 
•	Users are able to see which type of user they are, in the home page 
•	Each user type has its own access regarding type of user. 
•	Users can use the link appears in the home page, but each link has its own authorization of type. 
•	Users can browse to their profile page and add their info (Last Name - First Name - Body) 
• Users can write a question and write an answer with the authority to edit or delete.
